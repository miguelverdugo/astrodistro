# astrodistro: Generate lists of objects following a distribution function

To be used/merged in scope_sim.sources but also as standalone 

## Spatial distributions  (2D on the plane)

  - NFW Profiles
  - King Profile
  - Gaussian
  - Sersic
  - Power Law

## Luminosity distributions

  - Schechter
  - Power Law
  - Two component power law for AGNs, (is necessary?)
  - IMFs?
  - Uniform

## Considerations

  - Use the astropy.modelling framework
  - Luminosity distributions can be redistributed into spatial ones, and viceversa
  - Spatial distributions should also accept ellipticity
